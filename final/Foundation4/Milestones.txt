For my CSE 210 final project, I am working on the Foundation 4 option.
So far, I have completed Program 1 (Abstraction - YouTube Videos) and Program 2 (Encapsulation - Online Ordering).
In the YouTube program, I created a Video class that stores video details and manages a list of comments.
I also made a Comment class so users can leave comments on each video.
The program displays video information along with all comments.

For the Online Ordering program, I created Product, Customer, Address, and Order classes to handle product details, customer information, and order processing.
The program calculates total costs, generates packing labels, and creates shipping labels based on the customer's address.

I have tested both programs, and they run without errors.
Next, I will work on Program 3 (Inheritance - Event Planning) and Program 4 (Polymorphism - Exercise Tracking) to complete the project.
